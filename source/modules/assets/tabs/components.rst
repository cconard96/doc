.. note::

   The creation / management of components can be found in the menu :doc:`Setup > Components <.../configuration/components>`.

You can add a component by selecting the type from the drop-down list at the top of the table, then its name and the number of components to be added.

From an asset, you can modify a component by clicking on the link of its name.

To perform an action on several components (modify a common field, activating or changing financial information, deleting financial information, etc), select them in the right-hand column and then use the Actions button at the top or bottom of the list.

If you select several different types of components that do not have the same fields available to modify, you will be asked which component type you wish to work on.
