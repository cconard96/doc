Debugging information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If in your preferences you have set the `Debug` mode, a "Debug" tab will appear before the *All* tab. This tab offers information to help you resolve an issue.

For example, for a computer, you have one or more tables depending on the affected object (financial information, reservations...) listing the notifications that will be triggered on this computer with:

* the triggering event
* the recipient(s)
* the notification model used
* the recipient(s) email address
